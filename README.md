# laser-mouse (Hack&Roll 2021)

## Description
Lazers are always fun, and we add up shiny reflective metal spoons to the mix!

This is **laser-mouse**, a.k.a. how to control your mouse using lasers and spoons.  
Two parts: laser pointer tracking using your webcam, and DIY capacitive touch sensors using spoons.

## Inspiration
COVID-19. E-learning and home-based learning. Boredom. 
One of us has a drawing tablet that he uses to teach during the pandemic. Why not make one with lasers and webcams? To make it even better, use stuff we have at home, like spoons!

## What it Does
It is able to move your mouse cursor and make inputs. Perfect to play rhythm games, to draw, and for general use. If you can use a tablet, you can use LAZERMOUSE.

Made for Hack&Roll 2021.
